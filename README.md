In the first file labled "Math 124 Project 2", I have an example of some of the work that I have done in Julia through Jupyter Notebooks.
This was a project for a coding class that I took where we were tasked with creating an nxn maze.
Then, we had to find a path between verticies of the maze.
This project was fun to complete. It helped me grow my recursion skills and algorithm design/logic abilities!
