In the first file labled "Math 124 Project 2", I have an example of some of the work that I have done in Julia through Jupyter Notebooks.
This was a project for the coding class that focused on programming for mathemetical applications.
For the project, we were tasked with creating an n-by-n maze. Then, we had to find a path between verticies of the maze.
This project was fun to complete. It helped me grow my recursion skills and algorithm design/logic abilities!

In the second file labled "HW 6-Casey Messersmith", I have an example of some of the data visualization work I have done in R.
This was a homework assignment for a statistics class that focused on programming for data science projects.
For the assignment, we were tasked with creating various visualizations of a given data set.
This assignment helped me improve my knowledge of the R language and how to effectively model statistical results in a colorful and engaging graphic!
